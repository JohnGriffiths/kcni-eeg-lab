# Studies folder 

This repository and documentation site does not contain specific details for individual studies. 

Those details are to be found in the github repo associated with each individual study. 

Those repos are added as *submodules* in the `studies` folder. 

( Note that these will no be visible to you if the study repo itself is not public, or you have not been granted access to it. )

Study repositories contain study-specific information, including code for running the experiment (e.g. `psychtoolbox`, `psychopy`), and for data analysis. They will not contain actual data or any sensitive information.
